# Data-Structures and Algorithms
This project shows examples of commonly seen data structures and algorithms in the Python programming language. The aim of this repo is to provide people who are learning the Python programming language an easy to use reference for the most common data structures that can be seen.

Data Structures:
- Stack
- Queue
- DeQueue
- Hashing
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

Searching Algorithms:
- Binary Search
- Sequential Search

Graph Searching Algorithms:
- Uniform Cost Search
- Breadth First Search
- Depth First Search

Sorting Algorithms:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Shell Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

Machine Learning Algorithms:
- Markov Decision Process - Value Iteration

Data structures and algorithms are a very important part of learning a programming langauge. These structures and algorithms allow you to create more robust programs that perform better and consume less memory. By studying these you can take the first steps towards learning more advanced data structures and algorithms.

This project uses Python 3.6 in some areas through the use of 'f strings'. If you wish to use earlier versions of python then remove the f strings and replace with a different form of string concatenation.
