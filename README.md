# Data-Structures and Algorithms
This project shows examples of commonly seen data structures and algorithms in the Python programming language. The aim of this repo is to provide people who are learning the Python programming language an easy to use reference for the most common data structures that can be seen.

Currently the data structures that are present in this repo are as follows:
- Stack
- Queue
- DeQueue
- Hashing
- Singly Linked List
- Doubly Linked List

Currently the searching algorithms that are present in this repo are as follows:
- Binary Search
- Sequential Search

Currenty the graph searching algorithms that are present in this repo are as follows:
- Uniform Cost Search

Currently the sorting algorithms that are present in this repo are as follows:
- Bubble Sort
- Selection Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Merge Sort
- Shell Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort

Data structures and algorithms are a very important part of learning a programming langauge. These structures and algorithms allow you to create more robust programs that perform better and consume less memory. By studying these you can take the first steps towards learning more advanced data structures and algorithms.

This project uses Python 3.6 in some areas through the use of 'f strings'. If you wish to use earlier versions of python then remove the f strings and replace with a different form of string concatenation.
